# ComingSoon-PHP-Template
Simple "Coming Soon" landing page with PHP backend and countdown timer.

- Live countdown timer  
- Email collection to `emails.txt`  
- Responsive design  
- No database required  

## How it works
- `index.php`: main page with launch date and timer
- `save_email.php`: receives form submission and writes to `emails.txt`
- `style.css`: simple styling with a dark sci-fi theme
- `script.js`: countdown timer (inline for simplicity)

> You can deploy it to any PHP hosting or use it as a base for WordPress under maintenance mode.
